  <h3>Program Features:</h3>
    <b>Manipulate .csv & plain text files: </b>
    <ul>
        <li> Can write data to a newly created file, </li>
        <li> Append data to an existing file. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Regression Analysis: </h4>
    Currently only linear regression analysis is supported until the foreseeable future. The program asks for a file name to perform the analysis on. It outputs the least square regression equation of the supplied data set. It also offers performing an estimation using the calculated equation. If an estimation is performed, it offers to save the equation & estimated result in a plain text file. The test file is named "regression_*filename*.txt.
    <h4>Correlation: </h4>
    Calculates the Pearson co-efficient of correlation of the supplied data set.
    <h4>Data Sorting: </h4>
    Asks the user whether to sort the supplied data set in ascending or descending order of the dependent variable. The sorted data is stored in a .csv or plain text file (whichever extension is supplied by the user) with a filename of "sorted_*filename*".
